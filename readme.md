# ML Api

This repository is made by me to demonstrate an example of how you can make a 
REST Api over a Machine Learning model.

This example uses FAST Api to build the REST Api and the whole code to get 
the REST Application working is less than 30 lines and is present in the 
[main.py](./main.py) file.
